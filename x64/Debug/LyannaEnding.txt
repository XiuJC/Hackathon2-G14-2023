Looking at the dying mage who used to take care of a lot of the members in the party, Ozen still could not 
accept the fact that the lady he treated like his daughter had been corrupted and tried to kill him. 

Ozen slowly stands up, trying to figure out what happened to the rest of the party. He takes a charm 
from the mage, one of a series of rings which was owned by each of the members in the party. Ozen is tired.
 
He has to report the situation in the dungeon to the kingdom guards waiting outside. He steps on his feet. 
It had been a long time since the last time he experienced such heavy steps. The fatigue exhausts him. 
He never thought that the way back would be so long that he can’t feel himself getting close to exit......
