                                  Stage 3 COMPLETED
The golem was tough, but it does not hold you back, you remember why you like to fight at the 
first place, the adrenaline..., the exciting emotions..., you reminisce through those memories, 
there is only one difference, you feel tired easier as time goes by... You drag yourself into a 
tunnel pass the remnant of the golem...
