Barely winning the fight, Ozen turns back, stepping to the exit of the room. He still cannot believe that even the strongest among the party also fell to the curse.
Faust : Ozen......

 A familiar voice grabs the Ozen’s attention. 
Ozen looks at the hero lying on the floor. He notices that the dark aura is leaving the body of the man. 

Faust: Thanks, mate...
 Said the man while trying to stand up on his own but falls with his face directly onto the floor.
Ozen: You must be having a tough time, huh ? 

The quiet dwarf says while picking him up. 
Ozen: Need some help?
 Ozen stands in front of Faust, staring at his face. 

Faust : You... old cruel stubborn dwarf...

 The hero can barely stand up this time. 

Ozen : You are gonna be asked about all this mess. Do not waste my time, we have to leave this place.
 
Faust : Ehh... Why I have to meet that troublesome old man again? Hey Ozen, take me along with you, 
        just anywhere except the Palace. You have to be responsible for all these wounds. 

Ozen : ...Sounds fair to me.

The two old friends head towards the exit while complaining to each other about their good old days.
