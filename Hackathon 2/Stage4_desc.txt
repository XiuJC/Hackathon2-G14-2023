The tunnel keeps narrowing down and it is the only road. The spiky rocks look sharp and it 
will be horrible if you get caught in one of those. It is fortunate that you have a smaller 
body to go through that narrow hole at the end of the tunnel. What a huge cave, the sound 
of something breathing echoes in the cave, the sound is too large for an animal, and that 
does not sound good...
