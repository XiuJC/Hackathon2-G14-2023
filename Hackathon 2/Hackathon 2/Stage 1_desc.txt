The Entrance
It is cold and dark here. You with the light source from your torch seems... alone. You can hear that the heavy door at your back is slowly shutting. Besides the dripping water sound echoing in the hallway, you can also hear a small giggling sound in front...
Stage 1 COMPLETED: Look like you clear the area, you rekindle the torches on the walls,the entrance is much brighter now. The long and narrow hallway leads you to the staircase going downstairs,it is looking quite dangerous down there.
