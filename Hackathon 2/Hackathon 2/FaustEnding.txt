Barely winning the fight, Ozen turns back, stepping to the exit of the room. He still can’t believe even the strongest among the party also fall to the curse.
“Ozen……” A familiar voice grabs the warrior’s attention. 
Ozen looks into the hero lying on the floor. He notices that the evil aura is leaving the body of the man. 
“Thanks, mate….” The man tries to stand up on his own but falls with his face directly onto the floor.
“You must be having a tough time, huh?” The quiet dwarf says to the human, approaching him slowly. 
“Need some help? ” Ozen stands in front of Faust, staring at his face. 
“You old cruel stubborn dwarf…” The hero can barely stand up this time. 
“You’re gonna be asked about all this mess. Don't waste your stamina, we have to leave this place.” 
“Then stay with me till I fully recover... I don’t want to meet that old man alone.”
Two men walk together in the dungeon, heading towards the exit while complaining to each other about their old days.
