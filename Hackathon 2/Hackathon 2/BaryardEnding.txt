“Dad…? ”
“I thought…. I’ll never…. have a chance to see you again….” The young warrior says but Ozen couldn’t feel like the young one is talking to him. 
“Sorry…. I still can’t….. be your proud……”
Without finishing his last word, the young warrior leaves the old warrior alone in the room. A drop of tear runs down Ozen's face. He stares at the young man’s face, holding his hand tightly but stays in silence. 
Knowing that he couldn’t safely leave the dungeon while carrying a person, Ozen takes a halberd which is owned by the young man. It had been years since he held a weapon like that. 
Instead of leaving the dungeon to report the situation, Ozen decides to take a rest first. He is already tired of the battles and killings. He takes a nap, hoping there will not be any burdens when he awakes next time…….
